PYTHON PROJECT 1 -"FOOD DELIVERY TIME"
TASK OVERVIEW:
  In this project,I'll explore the realm of Machine learning more by building a food delivery time prediction in python using ML algorithms.
NEED FOR TIME PREDICTION:
  Food Delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy need to show the accurate time it will take to deliver your order to keep transparency with their customers. These companies use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the food delivery time based on how much time the delivery partners took for the same distance in the past.
WHAT I WILL DO:
 To predict the food delivery time in real-time, we need to calculate the distance between the food preparation point and the point of food consumption. After finding the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations, we need to find relationships between the time taken by delivery partners to deliver the food in the past for the same distance.
ABOUT MY DATASET:
  I need a dataset containing data about the time taken by delivery partners to deliver food from the restaurant to the delivery location.
  FEATURES OF MY DATASET:
  1. ID: order ID number 
  2. Delivery_person_ID: ID number of the delivery partner
  3. Delivery_person_Age: Age of the delivery partner
  4. Delivery_person_Ratings: ratings of the delivery partner based on past deliveries
  5. Restaurant_latitude: The latitude of the restaurant
  6. Restaurant_longitude: The longitude of the restaurant
  7. Delivery_location_latitude: The latitude of the delivery location
  8. Delivery_location_longitude: The longitude of the delivery location
  9. Type_of_order: The type of meal ordered by the customer
 10. Type_of_vehicle: The type of vehicle delivery partner rides
 11. Time_taken(min): The time taken by the delivery partner to complete the order

DATA PREPARATION:
 I'll begin my data preparation for model training ensuring data cleanliness,handle missing values,and perform any necessary steps.
MODEL TRAINING:
 I utilize python libraries such as pandas,numpy and plotly to train my model on the prepared dataset.
VISULAIZATION:
 I created visual representation such as scatter plot and box plot using plotly for high-level interavity.
